    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Molten chocolate cakes became famous for a reason: they're cakey on the outside with an irresistible center of
        warm dark chocolate flowing through the middle. It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version
        of this amazing cake created by master chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But his recipe is in a class all by
        itself. The first time you try one, it may seem like magic, but this recipe is actually quite easy to make and
        ready in under an hour.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Stick of Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>6 Ounces of Bittersweet Chocolate</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup of Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>A Pinch of Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450Â°. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out the excess flour. Set the
            ramekins on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt the butter with the chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the
            eggs with the egg yolks, sugar and salt at high speed until thickened and pale.</li>
        <li>Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along with the flour. Spoon the
            batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the
            centers are soft. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert
            plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10 seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
